<p>Hi everyone,
I'm Simona Valente and this is a short presentation.</p>

<p>I have focused my training and career mainly in two areas:
<p>â€¢ <b>Data analysis</b>;</p>
<p>â€¢ <b>Communication</b>.</p>

<p>Data analysis is an area that I am deeply passionate about for three reasons:
<p>1. <b>My insatiable curiosity</b>. I can explore unknown worlds through data, discover new perspectives and go beyond what is visible on the surface.</p>
<p>2. <b>If you know where to look, you can always find an answer</b>. The ability to extract meaningful insights from data is a challenge that fascinates me, as it involves the ability to transform raw data into valuable insights that can guide business decisions.</p>
<p>3. <b>Data analysis is a process that brings order to chaos</b>.</p>

<p>I would like to write that two of the qualities that distinguish me are <i>passion</i> and <i>determination</i>, but it is probably a sentence that you have read at least a million times. 
I can tell you that I am a <b>trekking enthusiast</b>. I love exploring uncontaminated nature that leaves me breathless. At the moment the most important conquest I have made is the <i>Teide Volcano (3715 m.)</i>. For me it was an extraordinary feat because I suffer from vertigo and I never thought I would succeed!</p>

<p>My love for hiking taught me to face obstacles with determination, to find creative solutions to overcome them and to challenge myself to overcome my limits.</p>

<p>I apply the same level of commitment and dedication to every aspect of my professional life, which is why I firmly believe in the importance of enthusiastically pursuing your goals, learning new things and constantly increasing your skills.</p>

<p>I consider myself a person of <b>loyalty</b> and <b>integrity</b> towards my <b>colleagues</b>. I believe that being able to establish a positive collaboration is synonymous with success in work and in life.<p>

<p>I thank you for your attention and send you my warmest regards.</p>
<i>Simona Valente</i>
